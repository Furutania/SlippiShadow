# SlippiShadow
Train a Neural Network using slippi game files to create an AI that plays just like you!

## Training
Using the py-slippi module to read .slp files, like gamestate and player information

User input and game state is sent to LSTM to predict the next optimal move
## Apply 
Use lib-melee to allow trained AI to interact with game

## Progress
Processed important gamedata frame by frame into a usable data array

## TO DO
Ensure data simularity between py-slippi and lib-melee
Train model
Allow model to interact with game live
